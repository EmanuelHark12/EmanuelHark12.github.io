    "analysis-text-01-02": "In this analysis, we'll start by comparing the five worst performances made in the last 6 seasons to scores in the first 12 games.",
    "analysis-text-01-03": "Based on these numbers, we can see that the lowest scores were repeated in previous years, but the evidence of irregularity comes from the fifth worst performance (20 points), in addition to the third (14 points), second (12 points) and first (4 points) , which are the worst in years.",
    "analysis-text-01-04": "It can also be seen from this graph of shooting attempts on the court by season, that the difference in the drop in score is also due to the low percentage of the three-point ball.",
    "analysis-text-01-05": "On these graphs, it is notable that there are a large number of three-ball errors most concentrated in the current season. In addition, in the current season, the shots from three points farther from the court line are not seen, which is one of the differential plays in Damian Lillard's career, as you can see in the video below.",
    "analysis-text-01-06": "To better observe this result, all shots made in previous games sampled were analyzed and cataloged in the following table.",
    "analysis-text-01-07": "According to the table, it is clear the decay of the percentage in points of 3 in the current season (25.4%) in more than 5% compared to the year with the lowest percentage (2017-18 -31.4%) and in relation to the At the same level of pitch production that started in the 2019-20 season, the decay was over 12%.",
    "analysis-text-01-08": "As for the other types of throw, they maintained a level similar to previous years in terms of medium-distance throw and in the lane, but in the free throw area they had the highest percentage (45.2%). In addition to this feature, we will analyze the main remaining features.",
    "analysis-text-01-09": "It is possible to see that there was an average increase of more than one assist per game (8.16) made by Damian in the current season compared to the others, but there was an average comparative decrease in the current season free-throw percentage of almost 10% (84 .6%), in more than 5 points (20) and in more than 5% in 3-point baskets.",
    "analysis-text-01-10": "The main observations taken from Damian Lillard's declining performance earlier this season were the drop in three-ball use, which lowers his score by more than 5 points on average than in other seasons in the same number of games. However, if he continues with his positive assists and shooting metrics in the free-throw area and increases his three-ball usage, he will be able to take Portland to higher levels.",
